WELCOME TO THE TOMI TOUR REPOSITORY


This Readme file contains all the instructions on how to fully use the Tomi Tour web application.

The tomi tour web application functions like a normal web app. The first page which is the home page has different sections which are the Popular destination section, popular guides section, maps and then the footer.
There is also the navbar which has links to other pages. The Tomi tour web app  is still a prototype so some certain features or pages haven't yet been implemented e.g the tour guide dashboard and the accomodations page.

The Tomi tour web app doesn't require you to sign in or sign up before you can access it so you can immediately just go straight into using the features available.

Once you have entered the website and gone through the home page just head on straight to the itineray page ( this page contains all the available itinaries a tourist can book ) you can then click on any itinerary that suits you.
Also by the side of the book button on the itinerary page you would see a small input field with all ready preset numbers this field is there so you the user can specify how days you want to experience the destination you picked. Now the preset numbers on the field show the minimun amount of days that can be picked.

Now once all that is done and you click on book you will be redirected to Stripe's api endpoint which handle the payment authentication. This is a test api so you cannot use your actual card number 
These are the card numbers you can use;

4242424242424242
4000002500003155
4000000000009995


These cards will output different results like success, declined or requires authentication. Once that is done you will be redirected to a booking page where you can book the tour guides once you click on book you will be redirected to google calender where you can book a time slot ( currently since i don't have any registered tour guides it's the appointment schudule of my email that would show up)
Once that is done you can either go back to the booking page then go home or just close the app
